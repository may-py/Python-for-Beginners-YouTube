# Operator

# Assignment Operator
# x = 60
# print(x)
#
# a,b = 10,3
# print(a)
# print(b)

# Arithmetic operator
# print(a + b)
# print(a - b)
# print(a * b)
# print(a / b)
# print(a % b)
# print(a ** b)
# print(a // b)

# a = a + b
# print(a)

# a+=b
# print(a)


# Relational operators
# a = 10
# b = 5

# Equal to ==
# print(a==10)

# Grater than >
# print(a>b)

# Grater than or equal to >=
# print(a>=11)

# Less than <
# print(a<b)

# Less than or equal to <=
# print(a<=b)

# Not equals to !=
# print(a!=b)


# Logical Operators


# a = 10
